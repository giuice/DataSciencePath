    "# Regular Expressions Basics\n",
    "As powerful as regular expressions are, they can be difficult to learn at first and the syntax can look visually intimidating. As a result, a lot of students end up disliking regular expressions and try to avoid using them, instead opting to write more cumbersome code.\n",
    "\n",
    "difficult regex\n",
    "That said, learning (and loving!) regular expressions is something that is a worthwhile investment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you understand how they work, complex operations with string data can be written a lot quicker, which will save you time.\n",
    "- Regular expressions are often faster to execute than their manual equivalents.\n",
    "- Regular expressions are supported in almost every modern programming language, as well as other places like command line utilities and databases. Understanding regular expressions gives you a powerful tool that you can use wherever you work with data.\n",
    "The dataset we will be working with is based off this CSV of Hacker News stories from September 2015 to September 2016. The columns in the dataset are explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the story\n",
    "- title: The title of the story\n",
    "- url: The URL that the stories links to, if the story has a URL\n",
    "- num_points: The number of points the story acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the story\n",
    "- author: The username of the person who submitted the story\n",
    "- created_at: The date and time at which the story was submitted\n",
    "- For teaching purposes, we have reduced the dataset from the almost 300,000 rows in its original form to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. You can download the modified dataset using the dataset preview tool.\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Import the pandas library.\n",
    "2. Read the hacker_news.csv file into a pandas dataframe. Assign the result to hn.\n",
    "3. After you have completed the code exercise, use the variable inspector to familiarize yourself with the dataset."
