    "Being a good programmer is a big part of what makes a good data engineer. Even though programming is not strictly related to working with data, a study on LinkedIn job postings showed that about 50% of job postings for data engineering positions explicitly mention that they are looking for candidates that are good programmers. Moreover, most job interview processes have a generic coding interview and there, again, it is important to be a good programmer and problem solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will learn how to analyze how good an algorithm is in terms of speed and memory. Simply put, an algorithm is a program or function that solves some specific problem. For example, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that, given a list of values, outputs that same list of values but rearranges them in increasing order. There are numerous ways to write a Python function that sorts data. After completing this course, you will be able to compare different solutions of the same problem, for instance, sorting, and select the best in each given context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moore's law predicts that every two years, the speed of computers doubles. However, despite this, if our algorithms are poorly designed, these algorithms take longer to execute over time. The reason for this phenomena is that the speed of computers is not the only thing that is increasing over time: data is also growing, and it seems that it is growing at the same rate as the speed of computers!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both speed and data are growing at the same rate, shouldn't the computation time remain the same? After all, we double the amount of data that we want to process every two years, but we do it on a computer that is twice as fast. Well, that depends on the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some algorithms, the execution time is proportional to the amount of data that it processes. This means that for such algorithms, the execution time will remain somewhat the same over time. However, not all algorithms exhibit this property. The goal of this course, is to learn how to analyze the way the execution time of an algorithm changes with the data given to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by writing an algorithm that, given a list of numbers, outputs the maximum value of that list. After all, before we can start analyzing algorithms, we need to have some algorithm to analyze."

    "In our analysis on the previous screen, we needed to count how many times each line of code was executed. However, we cannot always do that. Consider for instance the maximum() function from before:\n",
    "\n",
    "def maximum(values):\n",
    "    answer = None\n",
    "    for value in values:\n",
    "        if answer == None or answer < value:\n",
    "            answer = value\n",
    "    return answer\n",
    "How many times is the line answer = value executed? Well, that depends on the values list. The first time, it is always executed because answer is initially set to None. After that, it depends on the order of the elements in values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] then, at every subsequent iteration, answer < value will be true, so the line will be executed one time for each value. On the other hand, if values = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] then, the first time answer will be set to 5 and then the line will never be executed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that the first is a worst case execution analysis and the latter a best case execution analysis. When building a model for the execution time of an algorithm, we often focus on the worst case. There a few reasons for doing so:\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually want to process data from a lot of different sources and, consequently, it turns out that the worst case actually occurs quite often.\n",
    "It provides an upper bound. By focusing on the worst case when building the execution time model, we can guarantee that the executions times will always behave at most as badly as the models predicts. Imagine that your are selling an algorithm that 1% of the time takes one second and 99% takes over a one year. If you advertise it as taking one second (best case), your customers will not be very pleased.\n",
    "In practice, this means that when building the model, the number of executions that we set for each line of code is the maximum number of times that it can possibly be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, let's build a model for the maximum() function and see whether it matches our experimental prediction.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def maximum(values):\n",
    "    answer = None                            # c1, 1 time,  c1\n",
