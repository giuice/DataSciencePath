    "In this mission, we'll continue working with the World Happiness Report and explore another aspect of it that we haven't analyzed yet - the factors that contribute happiness. As a reminder, the World Happiness Report assigns each country a happiness score based on a poll question that asks respondents to rank their life on a scale of 0 - 10.\n",
